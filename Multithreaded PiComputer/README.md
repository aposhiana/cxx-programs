## Multithreaded PiComputer

This program utilizes an implementation of Simon Plouffe's pi computing algorithm written by Fabrice Bellard. See [this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5905822/function-to-find-the-nth-digit-of-pi) as well as [Bellard's website here](http://bellard.org/pi/pi_n2/pi_n2.html).

The main purpose of writing this program was to demonstrate familiarity with writing multithreaded code in C++.

This code was originally written in Fall 2017 with help from Dean Mathias.
