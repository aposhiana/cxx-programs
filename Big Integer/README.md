## Big Integer

The BigInteger class allows the handling of astronomical numbers. It includes the following:

* Various constructors
* Copy constructor
* Move constructor
* Overloaded assignment operator
* Overloaded move assignment operator
* Overloaded extraction operator
* Overloaded + operator
* Overloaded += operator
* Overloaded * operator
* Overloaded += operator
* Overloaded == operator
* Overloaded <= operator
* Overloaded double conversion operator
* Overloaded postfix increment operator
* Destructor

The main.cpp provides does some basic testing of the BigInteger class. It utilizes a factorial result from [http://www.dcode.fr/factorial](http://www.dcode.fr/factorial) to verify some calculations. Rigorous testing for the class has yet to be written.

This code was originally written in Fall 2016 with help from Dean Mathias.
